Thank you for contributing to this project! Hereâ€™s a quick guide to help you get started.

## Workflow

1. **Create a Branch**
   - Before starting work on a new feature or bugfix, create a new branch from `main`:
     ```sh
     git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
     ```

2. **Develop Your Feature**
   - Make your changes in the new branch. Be sure to follow any coding standards and best practices.

3. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Once your changes are ready, push your branch to the repository:
     ```sh
     git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>
     ```
   - Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch.

4. **Pass All Checks**
   - Ensure that all CI checks (linting, tests, build, etc.) pass successfully on your PR.

5. **Request a Review**
   - Request a review from one or more team members. You can do this in the "Reviewers" section on your PR page.

6. **Get Reviewed**
   - Address any feedback and make necessary changes. Once approved, your PR is ready to be merged.

7. **Merge Your PR**
   - If there are no conflicts, merge your changes into `main`.
   - If conflicts arise, resolve them before merging.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your branch is up to date with `main` before opening a PR.
- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Keep your changes focused; avoid bundling multiple features or fixes in one PR.

Thatâ€™s it! Happy coding!
